# Owner TODO

Things only the owner can do: keys, accounts, real devices, real photos, prices.
Each item names the ticket, what is needed, and exactly where it goes.
Code for every item is already built; these are the steps that unlock it.

## T-133 — Region layer + US localisation

- [ ] **Apply migration 26 to production BEFORE deploying the web app or worker.**
  The new code selects `tenants.region`, `tenants.unit_system` and `services.tax_exempt`;
  without the migration, quote processing fails. File:
  `supabase/migrations/00000000000026_region_layer.sql` (backfills every existing tenant to `GB`).
  Use the same management-API route as migrations 24–25 (`scripts/deploy-migrations-24-25.sh` pattern).
- [ ] **Review the US painting pack rates.** Every number marked `TODO-OWNER` in
  `apps/web/src/lib/vertical-packs/painting-us.ts` is a placeholder (e.g. $375/room,
  $2.50/sq ft exterior, $1,200 exterior minimum). Replace with figures you are happy to show
  US businesses as starting defaults.
- [ ] **Real US photos for the US measurement check.** `scripts/hardcore-test/verify-t133.mjs`
  currently measures the UK S01 house photos as if it were a US job. Drop photos of a US
  house front (siding, 80 in front door visible) into a new gitignored folder
  `test-assets/hardcore/US-painting/` and point the script's `collectAssets(...)` path at it.
- [ ] **Check one US PDF and one US email by eye** once DocRaptor and Postmark keys are set
  (`DOCRAPTOR_API_KEY`, `POSTMARK_API_TOKEN` in Vercel env). Expect `$`, "Sales tax" and US date order.
  Code paths: `apps/web/src/lib/pdf-template.ts`, `apps/worker/src/email/index.ts`.

## T-135 — AI model registry + routing

- [ ] **Optional: an Anthropic API key** to try Claude for adjudication or identification. Set
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the worker (`wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and, to switch,
  `AI_MODEL_ADJUDICATION=anthropic:<model-id>`. The adapter is unit-tested but has never run live.
- [ ] **Deploy before 1 December 2026** — follow `DEPLOY.md` step by step (Queues chosen; Workers Paid done 2026-11-08). Google reroutes `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`
  that day; the new defaults move every task off 2.5 explicitly. Until this deploys, production runs
  the old defaults.
- [ ] **Budget for the January price change.** `gemini-3.8-flash` goes from $0.75/$3.75 to
  $1.50/$7.50 per 1M tokens on 1 January 2027 (Google pricing page). Update the `prices` block in
  `packages/shared/src/ai-models.json` then.

## T-136 — SMS channel (Twilio)

- [ ] **Create the Twilio account** and set `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` in Vercel env
  (web app). Without both, the platform stays in test mode and never sends a text.
- [ ] **Buy a US number** for the first beta business and enter it at `/app/sms`.
- [ ] **Register A2P 10DLC** (brand with legal name + EIN, then a campaign on a Messaging Service) in the
  Twilio Console, and paste the Messaging Service SID at `/app/sms`. US carriers block unregistered
  business texting at volume.
- [ ] **Point the number's "A message comes in" webhook** to `https://<your-domain>/api/sms/webhook` (HTTP POST).
- [ ] **Apply migration 27** (`supabase/migrations/00000000000027_sms_channel.sql`) to production.
- [ ] **Live test from a real phone:** text the number, send a photo by MMS, reply "yes", open the link;
  then text STOP and confirm the dashboard "Text link" refuses to send.

## T-134 — Subscription-only USD plans

- [ ] **Confirm the plan numbers** in `packages/shared/src/plans.ts` (every `TODO-OWNER`): Starter $49/50
  quotes, Pro $99/200 (14-day trial), Business $199/600, annual = two months free, and the US pre-trial
  allowance of 10 test quotes (`NO_SUBSCRIPTION_LIMIT.US`).
- [ ] **Create the Stripe test products and prices:**
  `cd apps/web && STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... npx tsx scripts/stripe-setup-plans.mts`, then paste the
  printed `STRIPE_PRICE_*` lines into Vercel env.
- [ ] **Enable the Stripe Customer Portal** (Settings → Billing → Customer portal): allow switching between
  the three products, proration on, cancellation at period end.
- [ ] **Apply migration 28** (`supabase/migrations/00000000000028_us_plans.sql`) to production.
- [ ] **Run the test-mode journey:** start the Pro trial (test card 4242…), let it convert (or end the
  trial in the dashboard), upgrade to Business, downgrade to Starter — check `/app/billing` follows each step.
